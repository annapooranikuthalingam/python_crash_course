"""
8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9. Write a function
called send_messages() that prints each text message and moves each message to a new list called
sent_messages as itâ€™s printed. After calling the function, print both of your lists to make sure
the messages were moved correctly.

6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of three names to use as keys
 in the dictionary, and store one to three favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit
 more interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop through the dictionary,
 and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite places.
